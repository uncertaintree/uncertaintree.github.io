My research interest is on applied statistical regression modeling with 
a focus on interpretation benefits 
- for researchers on the applied side, or even forest practitioners - 
by careful construction of a **probabilistic** formulation for the 
information present at a given study. 
With this, the aim is to get to a clear and robust picture of the unknown 
data-generating process.
