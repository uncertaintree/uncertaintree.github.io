My research interest is on applied statistical regression modeling with 
a specific focus on gaining interpretable / interpretation benefits 
- for researchers on the applied side, or even forest practitioners - 
by construction of a **probabilistic** formulation of the 
information present in a given study. 
With this, the aim is to get to a clear and robust picture of the unknown data-generating process.
