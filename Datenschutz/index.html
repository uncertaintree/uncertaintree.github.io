<p><b>Data Protection Declaration</b></p>

<p>Effective date: August 15, 2019</p>

I, the author of this website, take the protection of your - i.e. the user's - personal data very seriously.
<br> 
I do not collect or store any personal data myself. 
<br> 
However, these pages are hosted on third-party servers, and third-party content is incorporated by external websites.
This always presupposes that the respective providers perceive the IP address of the users, as without the IP address, they could not send content to the browser of the respective user.
The IP address is required for the presentation of the content. 
I have no control over any third-party provider's usage of the user's IP address, e.g. storage for statistical purposes.</p>

<p>Embedded Content:</p>
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. images, articles, etc.). 
Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party 
tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your 
interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

<!--### Service Providers
We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), 
to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing 
how our Service is used.
These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and

<!--##### Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. 
Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service.

personalize the ads of its own advertising network.

You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by 
installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics 
JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.
