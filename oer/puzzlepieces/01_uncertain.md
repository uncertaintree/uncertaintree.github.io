# Uncertainty

The concept of uncertainty is present in our lives, all the times. 
- We are uncertain about what the weather might be like on our way to work, ... .
- We are uncertain because things happen in the future, and the future is not here, yet. 
- But we are also uncertain about the past: This summer was extremely dry and hot - has this harmed the tree in front of my window? And if so, how much?

So we are uncertain because we can't know, but also because we don't know!
