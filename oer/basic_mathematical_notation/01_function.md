## Function, (Co-)Domain, Inverse Function, and Parameters

### Function
We need this all the time: 
Any method transporting observed measures such that the essential information becomes quantified is / can / should be expressed in the form of a mathematical function. 

#### Definition (Function)
A mathematical **function** is a special relationship where each input has a single output. 
A function named $f$ is usually denoted $f(x)=y$, where $x$ is the **input value** and $y$ is the **function value**. 
$f\left(x\right)$ maps all the values of the **domain** $X$ (the space or set of possible input values $x$) to the **co-domain** $Y$ (the space or set of possible function values $y$), which is denoted by: 

$$f:X\rightarrow Y,~x\mapsto y=f\left(x\right).$$

Read: ' $f$ is a function from $X$ to $Y$. $f$ maps $x$ to $y$. '

##### Example (Quadratic function)
The relationship $f(x) = x^{2}$, (Read ' $f$ of $x$ is $x$ squared ', or ' ... $x$ to the power of $2$ '), $x\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ (Read ' for $x$ from the positive real numbers '), is a function: 
$$f:\mathbb{R}^{+}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+},~x\mapsto x^{2}=f\left(x\right),$$ 
because each input $x$ has a single output $x^{2}$: 
$$f\left(1\right)=1,\quad f\left(3\right)=9,\quad f\left(\sqrt{z^{2}}\right)=z^2.$$

- The *square-root function* $g\left(x\right)=\sqrt{x}=x^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is the *inverse function* of $f(x) = x^{2}$.
- The common notation for this is $g\left(x\right)=f^{-1}\left(x\right)$. 
- The relationship between $f\left(x\right)$ and $g\left(x\right)$ is visualized by interchanging the axes.

The following figure illustrates the quadratic ('square') and the square-root functions.
