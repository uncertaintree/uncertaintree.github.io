This course aims to introduce basic R (programming) skills in relation to successful applied statistical modeling with R.

  <strong>Technical note:</strong> These materials were generated using <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown">bookdown</a>. 
  The contents are given in html, as well as in pdf format. 
  For 'hands-on' working with these materials, I recommend to use the html format, as there's a 'Copy to Clipboard' button at the top right corner of each of the code chunks. 
  However, here note the following issue (I must have done something wrong somewhere!): when opening one of those pages, this 'Copy to Clipboard' functionality only works as long as one does not click on one of the links provided by the structure at the left-hand margin of the site.

In autumn 2021, I scheduled 3 hours for each of the sessions. 
Session 01 took us 4 hours with rushing through the last topics, 5 hours would have been better. 
Session 02 took us 2 hours, without much time for the students for playing around with the code, 3 hours would have been better. 
Session 03 took us 3 hours, with 5 to 10 minutes for the students to work on each of the exercises, with then together discussing the results, so here the 3 hour schedule worked out nicely. 
Session 04 took us 3 hours, 30 minutes would have been nice in order to talk a bit more in details about the case study.
