<strong>Partial effects plot</strong>
<br>
A partial effects plot is a visualization of the influence of a covariate if all other covariates remain unchanged.
<br>
For example, in linear regression model:
\[
y_i=\beta_0+\beta_{1}x_{1,i}+\beta_{2}x_{2,i}+\epsilon_i
\]
such a partial effects plot is a representation of e.g. \(\beta_1\), i.e. the partial effect of input \(x_1\), with having the visual form of a straight line.
<br>
In this model we use the identity link which makes the partial effects plot representing not only the change of the linear predictor, but directly also of the conditional expectation \(E\left(Y_i\mid x_{1,i},x_{2,i}\right)\) of the response variable \(Y_i\). 
<br>  
As we will see later in the second additional point, this does not hold for non-linear link functions as used for almost any non-gaussian response model.   
<br>  
Taking this example further, if \(x_1\) now takes values between \(-1\) and \(1\), and an estimate for \(\beta_1\) is e.g. \(\hat{\beta}_1=0.5\), then the partial effects plot would look like a straight line from \((-1,-1 \cdot 0.5) \) to \((1,1 \cdot 0.5)\). 
<br>
Reversely, if we have a specific figure where the partial effects plot looks like a straight line from \((-0.08, -0.19)\) to \((0.14, 0.32)\), then the partial effect here is as that of a regression parameter \(\beta\) with value \(\frac{0.51}{0.22}\approx 2.3\).
<br>
<strong>Addition 1.</strong> 
Because we can, for example, also estimate non-linear, partial effects using a (spline) basis function approach, the 'partial effects plot' for a covariable can then also deviate from a straight line. 
<br>
But we can always, for any sub-interval of the covariate domain, make the same triangular calculation as above, i.e. we can set up piece-wise linear interpretation of the non-linear plot such that we get 'many' interpretations of a 'simple' regression coefficient. 
<br>
<strong>Addition 2.</strong> 
In the gamma regression with log link, for example, this partial effect is not immediately the change in the expected value of the target variable, but only the change in the linear predictor, i.e. on the log scale of the conditional expected value.
<br>
In a similar model to the above we would also have here:
\[
E\left(Y_i\mid x_{1,i},x_{2,i}\right)=\exp\left(\beta _0+\beta _{1}x_{1,i}+\beta _{2}x_{ 2,i}\right),
\]
or:
\[
\log\left(E\left(Y_i\mid x_{1,i},x_{2,i}\right)\right)=\beta _0+\beta _{1}x_{1,i}+\beta _{2 }x_{2,i}.
\]
Nevertheless, here in the partial effects plot a visualization of \(\beta_1\) would be displayed as a straight line, but the effect on the conditional expected value is non-linear due to the non-linearity of the link function.
